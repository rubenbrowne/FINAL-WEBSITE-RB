    <h2>Carp Posters</h2>
<br><br>
    <p2>The carp task is based on the annual hot air balloon 
        festival in Bristol, Europes largest festival of its 
        kind...</p2>
        
        <h4>In my first hot air balloon poster, I imagined
        the title having a soft indigo like colour with hot air balloons surrounding
        it. I started with my background, adding a light blue hazey gradient to signify
        the sky, following by the bristol suspension bridge; I knew I had to include the
        bridge within my posters at is it a key landmark of the city. I finally settled
        on a pastel blue colour theme, adding a few hot air balloons witih low opacity. Lastly
        I added a strip of colour with all of the contributing organisations, giving a streamline
        and subtle look.</h4>
        <div class="row">

        </div>
<br><br><br><br><br>
        <h4>In my second hot air balloon poster, I wanted to add a little
            bit more contrast for an exciting look and also wanted to
            incorporate some ab-normal shapes. I added a 'blob' like shape
            to the middle of the poster, adding in the suspension bridge, as I
            loved the feeling of being in the festival itself! I also warped the
            text and added white outliines shadowing the key infomation which turned
            out great in my opinion. Adding in the strip of the organisations and lastly 
            adding a dottedt overlay to tie in the whole poster.

    <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p2>The HTML/CSS task is showing the progression of my understanding
        on how to create a website</p2>
<br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Week 1-3</h3>
        
        <h4>Having never used HTML and CSS, i found these tasks to be quite 
            challenging. The syntax used in coding was confusing at first
            however, after the weeek two worksheet I started to grasp the 
            basic commands. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Completing weeks 1-3 developed my understanding of website
            formation. It was a gratifying feeling seeing the code relate
            to a working website. Setting up Github was one of the hardest
            tasks and still causes me issues, but I'm still inclined to develop
            my understanding further. </h4>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="images/week3.png">
                <br><br><br><br>
            
            </div>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Week 4-6</h3>

            <br><br>
            
        <h4>With Week 4-6 the tasks got more complexed, playing around with
            positioning, flexbox, styling a menu item, centering images,
            imbedding audio and publishing on github. I found these week
            tasksheets easier to comprehend as I was more familiar with
            the language HTML and CSS uses.
            <br>
            <br>
            Linking Youtube videos was surprisingly easy, only 2 lines of
            code and voila. I have looked at web fonts before which made the
            task more streamlined. However I was stuck on moving the menu icons
            for a while, only to realise the line of code was in the wrong position.
            Little mistakes that cause drastic issues, with an easy fix is one of the
            most exciting feelings I've experienced through using HTML/CSS. Overall, 
            coding in this format has been a scary but refreshing style of creative media 
            I had yet to experience, and will be looking forward to jumping into 
            the next coding module.
